# Match3-Game

A browser-based match-3 puzzle game built with JavaScript, inspired by popular games like Candy Crush and Bejeweled.

## About This Project

This is a classic match-3 puzzle game where players swap adjacent tiles to create matches of three or more identical items. The game features colorful graphics, smooth animations, and engaging gameplay mechanics that challenge players to achieve high scores.

## Purpose

This project was created as an assignment for my Game Programming class. The assignment objectives were to:
- Implement a fully functional match-3 game from scratch
- Practice JavaScript game development and algorithms
- Learn game logic and state management
- Apply object-oriented programming principles to game development
- Create an engaging user experience with smooth animations

## How to Play

1. Swap adjacent tiles by clicking/tapping on them
2. Match 3 or more identical items in a row or column
3. Matched items disappear and new ones fall from the top
4. Create cascading matches for bonus points
5. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Features

- Interactive tile swapping mechanics
- Match detection algorithm
- Falling animation for new tiles
- Score tracking system
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Clean and colorful UI
- Power up tiles

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** - Game logic and functionality
- **HTML5** - Structure and Canvas rendering
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations

## Context

I built this game as part of the coursework for my Game Programming class. The assignment challenged us to create a complete game with all the mechanics working properly. It was a great opportunity to apply programming concepts in a fun, interactive way and see how game development differs from other types of software development.

## What I Learned

- Implementing 2D array manipulation for game boards
- Creating smooth animations using JavaScript
- Handling user input and touch events
- Managing game state and scoring logic
- Optimizing performance for browser-based games
- Structuring code for maintainability
