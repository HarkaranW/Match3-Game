AI involvment: Tutor

My approach was to start with the small features and do the big ones at the end. I got a little carried away with the small ones and ended up doing almost all of them (didnt do the mouse touch). Features addeed: Time addition, Pattern tile, Disallow no-match swaps, Star tile and Show hints


My AI involment was mainly I asked AI to simplify the instructions as if its explaining it to a 5 year old kid. 

Challenges & Bugs:

Patterned Tiles
- Problem: New patterns (cross, circle, etc.) didn’t spawn on higher levels.
- Fix: Made sure to update board.level = this.level before generating the new board.

Hint System
- Problem: Game froze when pressing H.
- Fix: Ensured temporary swaps were properly reverted in memory and cleared matches after testing.

- Problem: Hints didn’t reset when starting a new level.
- Fix: Reset remainingHints and hintTiles in enter().

- Problem: Hint highlights stayed visible after swapping.
- Fix: Cleared hintTiles inside swapTiles() once a move was made.

Reflection: 
- I learned how to think more carefully about game state management.
- I practiced debugging logic bugs where temporary swaps weren’t reverted correctly.
